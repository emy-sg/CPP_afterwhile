   - So far, we have been usign the "iostream" standard library:
   		which provides "cin" and "cout" methods for reading from standard input and writing to standard output.

==> This tutorial will teach you how to read and write from a file.
==> This requires another standard C++ library called "fstream", which defines three new data types:
		
	1- "ofstream":
		This data type represents the output file stream and is used to create files and write information to files
	2- "ifstream":
		This data type represents the input file stream and is used to read information from files.
	3- "fstream"
		This
