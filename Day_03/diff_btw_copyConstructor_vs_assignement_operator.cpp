#include <iostream>

// Copy Constructor: "initialize" an object using another object of the same class.
// Copy Assignment operator: "create" new object using another object of the same class.

/*
			Orthodox Canonical Form:
		
				- Default constructor
				- Copy constructor
				- Copy Assignment operator (it can be: void operator=(const class&) OR class& operator=(const class&))
					==> the only difference btw them is:
						- In case of "void": class a = b = c = d; // wont work, let's tested :)
						- So it would be better and best practise to use "class&", in this case: class a = b = c; // work just fine
				- Destructor

/*
					Copy Assignement Operator

  The copy assignment operator lets you create a new object from an existing one by "initialization".
A copy assignment operator of a class A is not a nonstatic non-template member function that has one of the following forms:
	- A::operator=(A)
	- A::operator=(A&)
	- A::operator=(const A&)
	- A::operator=(volatile A&)
	- A::operator=(const volatile A&)

If you do not declare a "copy assignment operator" for a class, the compiler will implicitly declare one for you that is "inline public".

The assignement " x = y " calls the implicitly defined "copy assignement operator".

The implicitly declared "copy assignment operator" returns an lvalue reference to the operator's argument.
